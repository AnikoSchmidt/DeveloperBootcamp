    <p>That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. How long can two people talk about nothing? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. They were just sucked into space. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Damage report! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Besides, you look good in a dress. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Your shields were failing, sir. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Sure.</p>
    <p>You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. </p>
    <p>The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! We have a saboteur aboard. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll alert the crew. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? </p>

    <p>Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.</p>
    <p>Sorry, Data. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. You enjoyed that. Not if I weaken first.</p>
    <p>Your head is not an artifact! The unexpected is our normal routine. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Well, that's certainly good to know. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. and attack the Romulans. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I am your worst nightmare! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Computer, lights up! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone.</p>
